## Index

* `0. pedal midi info.ipynb`: understand MIDI files and how the ground-truth annotations are extracted

* `1. dataset preparation.ipynb`: how to build the dataset and generate excerpts

* `2.1 pedal onset classification.ipynb`: how to train `Conv2D-onset`

* `2.2 pedal segment classification.ipynb`: how to train `Conv2D-segment`

* `2.3 how mfcc performs on the small dataset.ipynb`: compare with SVM using MFCC features

* `3. piece-wise detection.ipynb`: how to fuse the decision outputs from `Conv2D-onset` and `Conv2D-segment` so as to perform the detection on a piano piece.

Trained models are saved in folder `./save-model`. Evaluation results for every piece in the testing set are saved in 'psegment-testresult_onset98_seg98.csv'.
